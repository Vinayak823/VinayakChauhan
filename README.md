# Task 5: Deploy a Static Website Using GitHub Pages

## 📚 What I Learned Today

### 1. **Version Control with Git**
Today I learned about Git, which is a distributed version control system that helps track changes in code over time. I now understand why developers use Git:
- To maintain a history of all code changes
- To collaborate with others without overwriting each other's work
- To experiment with new features using branches without affecting the main code
- To revert to previous versions if something breaks

### 2. **GitHub and Remote Repositories**
I learned how to work with GitHub as a remote hosting platform for Git repositories. Key concepts I grasped:
- Creating a repository with the special naming convention `<username>.github.io`
- Cloning repositories to work locally on my machine
- Pushing commits from local to remote repository
- Understanding the difference between local and remote repositories

### 3. **GitHub Pages - Free Static Hosting**
I discovered GitHub Pages, which is a free hosting service that turns a GitHub repository into a live website. I learned:
- How to enable GitHub Pages in repository settings
- That it works best with static websites (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- The URL format: `https://<username>.github.io`
- That changes go live automatically after pushing new commits

### 4. **Static vs Dynamic Websites**
I now understand the fundamental difference:
- **Static websites**: Pre-built HTML/CSS/JS files served directly to users, no server-side processing
- **Dynamic websites**: Content generated on-the-fly using server-side languages and databases

### 5. **Basic Git Commands**
I practiced essential Git commands:
- `git clone` - Copy a repository to local machine
- `git add` - Stage files for commit
- `git commit` - Save changes with a message
- `git push` - Upload local commits to GitHub
- `git pull` - Download changes from remote repository

### 6. **Deployment Workflow**
I experienced the complete deployment process:
1. Set up repository with proper naming
2. Develop website locally
3. Test files before deployment
4. Commit changes with meaningful messages
5. Push to GitHub
6. Enable GitHub Pages
7. Verify live deployment

### 7. **Branching Concept**
I learned that branches allow developers to:
- Work on features independently
- Keep the main branch stable
- Merge changes after testing
- Collaborate without conflicts

## 🚀 Skills Acquired

- Setting up and managing Git repositories
- Deploying static websites to production
- Understanding basic version control workflows
- Working with GitHub's hosting infrastructure
- Managing code through commits and pushes
